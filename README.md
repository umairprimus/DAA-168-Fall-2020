**Report**

We have tried to implement all three solutions to the N-queen problem along with the graph. The Brute Force & Dynamic Programming solutions are very CPU extensive therefore they tend to hand the browser.

We have also separted the running button for each solution so that the user can easily distinguish between all three.

The graph has also been implemented which uses dynamic data after the solution is finished running. By default, the graph will not be visible.

The most expensive solution is brute force which tends not to complete in the given time.

After that, dynamic programing solution is also very expensive.

Below is the comparision of all N-Queen Algorithms:
